- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
It is really cool to use the attributes inherited from parent class and add new attributes based on that.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think the house, library and cafe have basic functions. However, I am not sure if I need to worry about the maximum capacity of each house. I am also not sure if there're other improvements I should make to each class.
